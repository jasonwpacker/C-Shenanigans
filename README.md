When I was in college, back in the late 1900's (as the kids say), the language I struggled most with was C. 
Ironically, now that I'm all but forced to work in "modern" languages like Javascript and Python I find myself
wishing for the simple power of C. So while I hone my skills as a Python developer, I still want to dip back
into coding with my old nemesis, and that's what you're seeing here.
